    *crops*-: This database stores information about all crops in the following format-:

        Temperature range temperature_pref(Precise numbers create false confidence)
        Season            season
        SuitedTopography  topography
        additional        additional_senitivities

        Purpose-:In the final model, this database will be used to call out the associated data of any crop. This data would be user input and won't depend on other factors.

        Demo Constraints-: For the sake of demo, we don't take more than 15 crops. 

        Musings-: 
        (11/02/2026)-: As far as I(Ayushman Chabri) see, the user would pass the name of the crop he/she want to plant. Based on his/her location from the location database we would check if the soil,rainfall, temperature etc are suitable or not. If not our model would warn the farmer. Also based on prices data our model would predict the revenue  generated by the farmer and his expected loss or gain. The expenses(like fixed capital, pending loans etc. The prices for crop and stuff will be predicted by our model) however would have to be entered by the farmer, otherwise internet will be required.
